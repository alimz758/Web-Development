This is a simple Express App that I learned how to implement ejs files and make HTML Templates.

Since the files are large the npm packages (Express and ejs) are not included here.

you can simplt get them by entering : 

npm install express --save 

&

npm install ejs --save to the directory to run this

It's recommended to run it on Cloud9; that's how I did it.
